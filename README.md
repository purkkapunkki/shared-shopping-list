# Project 1: Shared shopping list

A web application that is used as a shared shopping list. In which you can view
individual shopping lists and then add, remove, list, collect, and uncollect
items in them.

## Running the application
Run the following command in the project's root directory:
```
docker-compose up
```
Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the application.

## Online deployment
https://shared-shopping-list-qdz1.onrender.com

Note that this uses Render's free tier, so the database will only be usable for 90 days. If there are any errors, this is probably the cause. If this happens, a new database needs to be added to Render using [these instructions](https://fitech101.aalto.fi/web-software-development/15-deployment-iii/1-deployment-and-databases-using-render/).
